GNU sed 3.01 is now available.

Copies can be obtained by ftp from prep.ai.mit.edu:/pub/gnu/sed-3.01.tar.gz
and from other sites (see the list of mirror sites at the end of
this message).

Sed is a "stream editor" -- used for scripted data transformations,
such as transforming a data stream within a pipeline.

This version is more Posixly Correct and has more reliable performance
than the 2.05 and older versions of GNU sed.  It should also be more
portable to unusual computer systems.  All known bugs except regular
expression performance (which, though better, still needs a fair bit
of work) have been fixed.

Please report bugs to bug-gnu-utils@gnu.org; please include the word
``sed'' somewhere in the Subject: line.
