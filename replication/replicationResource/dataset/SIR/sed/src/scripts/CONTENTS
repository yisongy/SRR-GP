This directory is used as a staging area from which
to run the test suite.

The default runall and runall-diff scripts should
be placed here.

There are some tests in the smoke test suite
which require several (10-30) seconds time to
execute.  If you want to learn more about the standard
and smoke test suites, please read the CONTENTS
and README files in the testplans.alt or inputs 
directory.
